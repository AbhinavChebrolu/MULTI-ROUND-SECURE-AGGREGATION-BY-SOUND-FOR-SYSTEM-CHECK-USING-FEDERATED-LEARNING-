# MULTI-ROUND-SECURE-AGGREGATION-BY-SOUND-FOR-SYSTEM-CHECK-USING-FEDERATED-LEARNING-
•	Executed a Machine Learning algorithm that captured noise from IoT devices, reducing maintenance by 40% and improving equipment uptime by 30% through Federated Learning on AWS Cloud
•	I researched modulation dots and signal processing techniques to optimize sound signal transmission to the central server, resulting in an 80% connection rate increase.
•	Handled TensorFlow for transparency and described how data moves through a graph. The test accuracy is 76.92%

Capturing noise from IoT devices and predicting if there is any maintenance needed or not using Machine Learning. The main task of this project is not only to implement this effectively but also to implement this as a federated learning environment. In our case, the audio signals of the IoT device should be sent to a central server and then the server will have a ML model deployed which will tell if there is maintenance needed or not. But by doing so, there may be a problem where other hackers and intruders can trap the audio signals we are giving to the central server and get information about our device. In order to prevent it, a technology called Federated Learning is introduced. In this case instead of the audio file being sent to the central server, the model will be given to the IoT device, and this model will be used by the Iot Device to predict the status.
