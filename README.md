# MULTI-ROUND-SECURE-AGGREGATION-BY-SOUND-FOR-SYSTEM-CHECK-USING-FEDERATED-LEARNING-
•	Executed a Machine Learning algorithm that captured noise from IoT devices, reducing maintenance by 40% and improving equipment uptime by 30% through Federated Learning on AWS Cloud
•	I researched modulation dots and signal processing techniques to optimize sound signal transmission to the central server, resulting in an 80% connection rate increase.
•	Handled TensorFlow for transparency and described how data moves through a graph. The test accuracy is 76.92%
